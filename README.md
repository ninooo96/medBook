# MedBook

Academic project focused on designing and developing a mobile application in the form of a social network, specifically tailored for a community of medical professionals. The platform facilitates the sharing of clinical cases and the exchange of expert opinions and insights, in order to support informed decision-making.

The mobile application was built using the Flutter framework and the Dart programming language, and is powered by Google Firebase's cloud infrastructure.
